description: Commit to Github, create PR
---

I want to create a PR for my current branch.
- Create a new branch if I am currently working on the main branch
- If it is necessary to create any new branches, do so in order to separate different concerns for the changes
- Follow the conventional commits specification in any commit messages
- First commit any open changes with sensible commit messages, keep them small, one per concern/area
- Diff my branch against the root branch for the current repo (either master or develop)
- From the diff come up with a sensible PR description. Do not include emojis in the pull request description. List changes file by file.
- Push the PR to github using the gh CLI
- Open the pull request in my browser
